Special Tokens: Natively handles [UNK], [CLS], [SEP], etc.

Encode/Decode: Converts text to token IDs and back.

Responsive UI: Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack
Logic: JavaScript (ES6+)

Structure: HTML5

Styling: Tailwind CSS

## How to Use
Open index.html in a browser.

To Encode: Enter text in the input box and click Encode. The resulting token IDs will appear in the result area.

To Decode: Enter comma-separated token IDs (e.g., 8, 15, 5) and click Decode. The original text will appear in the result area.
